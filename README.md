Moving alarm clock

Pin chart for Raspberry Pi Pico W in Chart.xlsx

For working clock you need following programs:
imu.py
vector3.py
main.py

Imu and vector3 are for gyroscope (drivers)

Start first extra batterypack (6 V) and then main battery pack (4,5 V). Alarm sounds after 5 seconds. You can change that in main.py in def Alarm_time().
